# pyrenode3

Copyright (c) 2023-2026 Antmicro

A Python library for interacting with Renode programmatically.

## Installation

Use pip to install pyrenode3:
```
pip install 'pyrenode3[all] @ git+https://github.com/antmicro/pyrenode3.git'
```

If you have Renode installed, then `pyrenode3` will interact with it.
Otherwise, if you don't want to install Renode, you can download a Renode package and set `PYRENODE_PATH` to its location.

## Running a demo

To quickly run a sample demo, download the package and run:

```
wget https://builds.renode.io/renode-latest.pkg.tar.xz
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antmicro/pyrenode3/main/examples/unleashed-fomu.py
export PYRENODE_PATH=`pwd`/renode-latest.pkg.tar.xz

ptpython -i unleashed-fomu.py
# ptpython or bpython is recommended over standard repl for better experience.
```

This will spawn a two-machine demo scenario and, when the Linux boots to shell, you will be able to interact with the simulation via bpython interface.

## Using pyrenode3 with different Renode configurations

`pyrenode3` can be configured using environment variables:

- `PYRENODE_PATH` - Specifies the location of Renode that will be used by `pyrenode3`.
    This can point to a package, an unpacked Renode directory, a Renode source directory with build output, or a portable binary.
    To modify the output directory used as a source of Renode binaries (location of `Renode.exe`), you must set the `PYRENODE_BUILD_OUTPUT` variable, with a path relative to the Renode source directory.
- `PYRENODE_PKG`, `PYRENODE_BUILD_DIR`, and `PYRENODE_BIN` - Deprecated aliases for `PYRENODE_PATH`.

The Renode path should be specified to use `pyrenode3` with a non-installed Renode.

If no variable is specified `pyrenode3` will look for the Renode installed in your operating system.
